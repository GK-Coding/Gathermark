# Gathermark: A WoW addon showing you data for your mining routes
## Installation
If you installed WoW on the default path, then you want to place all of the files in  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\Gathermark`
## Features
The main part of the addon is a frame on the left of the screen that shows you when you started mining and how many of each item you've looted since. Additionally, there is a slash command called /gmark or /gathermark (either works) that will show you the same info in the chat window, with a small amount of additional data.
